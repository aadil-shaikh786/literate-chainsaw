1. Create a new branch for your work.
2. Make changes and commit them to the new branch.
3. Push the branch to GitHub.

e. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a version control system that manages and tracks changes to files in a project. GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides additional collaboration features.

f. What does git diff do?
->
git diff shows the differences between the changes in your working directory and the last commit. It helps you see what has been modified before committing the changes.

g. What is the main branch?
->
The main branch is the default branch in a Git repository, where the stable, production-ready code is usually stored.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

No, it's best practice to create a new branch for any changes or new features. This allows for better management and review before merging into the main branch.
